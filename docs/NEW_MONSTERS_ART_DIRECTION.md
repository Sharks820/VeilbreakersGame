## Monster 1: CHAINBOUND
### Brand: IRON (Pure) | Tier: Common | Role: Defender

**Visual Concept:**
A mass of rusted chains that has formed into a vaguely humanoid shape. Where a heart should be, there's a corroded padlock that rattles with each movement. The chains are old, covered in rust and dried blood. Some links are broken, trailing behind it. It moves with a constant metallic clinking sound.

**Silhouette Description:**
Humanoid but loose, irregular outline made of chain loops. The padlock creates a focal point in the chest. Trailing chains extend the silhouette downward. Reads as "walking imprisonment."

**Key Visual Elements:**
1. Body formed entirely of intertwined rusted chains
2. Corroded padlock where heart should be (keyhole glows faintly)
3. Some broken chain links trailing behind
4. Rust and dried blood staining the metal
5. Vaguely humanoid shape but wrong proportions

**Visual Concept:**
What was once a deer now shambles forward on broken legs, mushrooms erupting from every wound. Bioluminescent spores drift from the fungal masses growing through its skull. The original body is barely visible beneath layers of parasitic fungal growth. It doesn't know it died seasons ago.

**Silhouette Description:**
Quadrupedal deer base with dramatic mushroom cap "crown" rising above. Antlers partially visible through fungal growth. Spore clouds create a hazy aura. Trailing mycelium creates wispy tail effect.
