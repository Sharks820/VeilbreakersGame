description = "Child of the Shield Wall - an ancient order sworn to hold the line against the Veil. Never retreats. Never leaves an ally behind."
backstory = "Born in a fortress overlooking the nearest Veil breach, raised to the sound of monsters dying against the walls. At 16, during a breach event, they held a collapsed gatehouse alone for six hours while civilians evacuated. The Compact didn't recruit Bastion - they requested transfer, wanting to take the fight TO the corruption instead of just holding it back. Speaks in short sentences."
