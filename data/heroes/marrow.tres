backstory = "Marrow was dying from age 8. By 12, they'd accepted death. Then they touched a dying bird and felt its remaining life flow into them. The disease stopped. But so did the bird. Years of learning to control it followed - to take only what's freely given, to give back what they've stored. The Compact found them healing plague victims in a quarantined village, taking a little from many to give much to the sick. Speaks softly, moves gently."
